# Once upon a time in Palampur

In the small town of **Palampur**, nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, lived an eccentric scientist named **Arjun** who was an ardent admirer of *Albert Camus*, *Nikola Tesla*, and the art of coding. He was known for his peculiar love for rice and potatoes, which were the main ingredients of his daily meals. Arjun was a reclusive man and rarely interacted with the townspeople, but they were tolerant of his eccentricities, as he had once managed to clear the town's No-Dues electricity bill by building a makeshift Tesla coil.

One stormy night, as the rain pattered against his window, Arjun found himself poring over his tattered copy of Albert Camus' "**The Stranger**." As he read the novel, his thoughts meandered towards the concept of existentialism and the absurdity of life. Suddenly, he was struck by a brilliant idea: to build a time machine to journey through the ages and meet his heroes, Camus and Tesla.

Arjun dedicated the next few months to perfecting his design, drawing inspiration from Tesla's work on alternating currents and electromagnetism. He wrote elaborate codes to control the machine's intricate systems, while subsisting on a diet of rice and potatoes that fueled his late-night work sessions.

> Finally, the day arrived when his time machine was complete. He entered the machine and set the date to 1940, hoping to have a philosophical discussion with Camus in Paris. As the time machine whirred to life, Arjun was transported into the past.

However, instead of arriving in 1940s Paris, Arjun found himself in a small village in Serbia, surrounded by lush green fields of rice and potatoes. It turned out that he had miscalculated a decimal point in his coding, causing the machine to malfunction.

As he wandered through the village, Arjun stumbled upon a young, ambitious inventor named **Nikola Tesla**. Together, they exchanged ideas on science, philosophy, and the beauty of life's absurdities. Arjun shared his love for Camus' work, while Tesla spoke passionately about his vision for the future of electricity.

With Tesla's help, Arjun fixed the error in his code and bid farewell to his new friend. He climbed back into the time machine, this time setting the coordinates for Paris, 1940.

In Paris, Arjun finally met his literary hero, **Albert Camus**. Over a hearty meal of rice and potatoes, they discussed the complexities of life and the human condition. Camus was intrigued by the notion of time travel and the impact of technology on the modern world.

Arjun realized that he had learned an invaluable lesson on his journey: that human connection and the exchange of ideas transcended time and space. As he returned to Palampur, he felt a renewed sense of purpose and a deeper understanding of the absurdity of life.

Inspired by his encounters, Arjun dedicated his life to fostering dialogue between the past and the present. He created a foundation that facilitated the exchange of ideas between thinkers of different eras, eventually leading to groundbreaking advancements in science, technology, and philosophy. The town of Palampur, once known for its No-Dues achievement, soon became a hub for innovation and progress, all thanks to the humble scientist and his love for rice, potatoes, and the wisdom of his heroes.
